# Binary_Classification_with_Artificial_Neural_Network
Yıldız Technical University END3971 - Artificial Intelligence &amp; Expert Systems Assignment #3

# Summary

We used keras library for Artificial Neural Network training, split input and output feature and scale input features with scikitlearn.StandardScaler() function. Set a threshold to build binary classified prediction of test data. After that we configured a confusion matrix because we need matrix values to calculate accuracy as given.\
\
Accuracy=(Number of Correct Predictions)/(Total Number of Predictions)
