# Const_Char_Array
PJATK CPP TASKS - ASSIGNMENT 2


- In the first line of the output: all letters which appear in both strings (only
letters, we ignore punctuation marks, spaces etc.). Lower- and uppercase letters
are considered equivalent ('b' and 'B' are the same letter). Each letter appearing
in both strings should be written only once;
- In the second line of the output: all letters which occur in the first string, but
do not occur in the second. Again, lowercase letters are considered identical to
the corresponding uppercase ones.

- The task should be performed by a function which takes two immutable arrays of
characters created in the main function. No auxiliary arrays are allowed. You should
not use the knowledge of the ASCII codes of specific letters.
