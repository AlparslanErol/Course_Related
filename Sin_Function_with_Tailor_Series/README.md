# Sin_Function_with_Tailor_Series
PJATK PSM Task_1

- This program is a Python based program that can generate Sin() function with usign a special type of Taylor Series as Maclauren Series.
- Iteration going until solution getting epsilon value closer to the exact value of this function.
- After that both calculated and the real values are compared on the screen.

## Arfuments for Inputation
- Only the angle value from 0 degree to 360 degree is wanted from user to calculate its sin() output.
