# Summary

K-means clustering is one of the simplest unsupervised machine learning algorithms. Here, we’ll explore what it can do and work through a simple implementation in Python.\
Some facts about k-means clustering:
1.	K-means converges in a finite number of iterations. Since the algorithm iterates a function whose domain is a finite set, the iteration must eventually converge.
2.	Compared to other clustering methods, the k-means clustering technique is fast and efficient in terms of its computational cost.
3.	It’s difficult to predict the optimal number of clusters or the value of k. To find the number of clusters, we need to run the k-means clustering algorithm for a range of k values and compare the results.
For clustering, we applied K-Mean clustering which is an unsupervised learning method.\
For clsutering it is important to select number of cluster.\
To select optimal number of cluster, we used Elbow Curve and decide optimal cluster number
for this model. Unsclaled x data used for k-mean input.\
       Because this is an unsupervised method y data is not used.
